So what are the features or requirements of distributed unique IDs?  ① Uniqueness: the generated ID is globally unique, and the conflict probability is minimal in a specific range.  ② Orderliness: the generated IDs are ordered according to some rules, which is convenient for database insertion and sorting.  ③ Availability: it can guarantee the high availability and the right ID generation at any time.  ④ Autonomy: in distributed environment, ID can be generated by itself without relying on central authentication.  ⑤ Security: do not expose system and business information, such as: number of orders, number of users, etc.    What are the methods for generating distributed unique IDs?
